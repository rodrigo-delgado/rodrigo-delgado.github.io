        <li><h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4></li>

          <p>I have seen the video and I’m reading the book as well.
            This chapter helped me to assosiate how mindfulness can help with Emotional Intelligence (EI). How we can train mindfullness paying attention to the body and how we can balance the Emotional Intelligence in life and work.
            Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to monitor ours and others fellings and emotions.
            In the context of work environment, emotional intelligence has three important skills: Stellar work performance, outstanding leadership and the ability to create the condition of happiness.
            A strong, stable and perceptive attention affords you calmness and clarity.<p>

        <li><h4> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4></li>
         <p>I find it really good especially when you are working in a stressfull envoiroment. I have read about the benefits of meditation in many places now, I’m practicing it and it really helps.</p>
