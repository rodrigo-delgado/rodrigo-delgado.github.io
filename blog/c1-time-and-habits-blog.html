    <h1>Times and Habits</h1>


<p>At the moment I am working full time in hospitality as a chef.  So my environment at work is a bit stressful.
I have to manage my time to work, study and exercise. Days are long but motivation is high and this is the
 perfect time to start practicing new habits.  I have not tried any habit techniques yet but I would like to
 try meditation and the pomodoro technique so I will experiment further with these.<p>
