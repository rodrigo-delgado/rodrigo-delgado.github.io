        <h3>Compassionate, Leadership and Meditations:</h3><hr />

        <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?:</h4>
        <p>I've had more bad than good experiences with leaders at work.  I used to work in hospitality and especially in a kitchen it can be really hard and high pressured work. Years ago I rememeber working with racist, arrogant and angry Head Chefs. No one in the team wanted to work with them because they treated people like rubbish. Work productivity wasn’t the best as the stress levels were high around workmates and staff would leave and new people would come but the same story repeated.</p>
        <p>At that time I remember promising myself that I would never treat people like that.  As a Head Chef I’m always trying to be friendly and compassionate with my work mates and I build strong and close relationships, I think this is one of the keys to success.</p>

        <h4>Multiplying and Tonglen Meditation:</h4>
        <p>This went really well. I think the intresting thing about this kind of meditation is the way that you get rid of all negativity and you fill yourself with positive energy, it just feels great!</p>

        <h4>SCARF Model:</h4>
        <p>I think that autonomy on the SCARF model effected me the most in phase 0. These 9 weeks has been really stressful because it’s so much work to do in so little time. Certainty is another factor that has been impacting me in phase 0, I think to much about how much work I have to do and I’m uncertain that I will complete it all in time. This stops my mind from concentrationing 100% on the studying. I am unsure at the moment on how the SCARF model will affect me in boot camp but I’m guessing it will be very similar to phase 0. </p>

        <p>“You can make more friends in two months by becoming really
        interested in other people than you can in two years by trying
        to get other people interested in you. Which is just another
        way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one".</p>
        <p>—Dale Carnegie</p><hr />
