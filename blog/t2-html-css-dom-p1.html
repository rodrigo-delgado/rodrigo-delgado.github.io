        <li><h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4></li>

          <p>A car as analogy of a webpage:</p>

           <p>The HTML of a car would be the structure of this, for example, the frame, the chassis, the door, the windows, the mirrows etc. The CSS provides the style, the painting, shape, the colour of the lights, basically the general look and feelâ€¦ Sweet car!</p>

         <p>The DOM is the driver. The person who understands how to drive the car and control the mechanism of the car, when to change gear, accelerate, stop or change a flat wheel.</p>

      <li><h4> What is meant by boxifying design?</h4></li>
      <p>boxifying design means that  all the elements we can see on a webpage are within boxes/square or rectangular shapes, even the circules are inside boxes</p>
    <li><h4>What is the box model?</h4></li>
    <p>The box model is the specification that defines how a box and its attributes relate to each other. In its simplest form, the box model tells browsers that a box defined as having width 100 pixels and height 50 pixels should be drawn 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall.</p>
