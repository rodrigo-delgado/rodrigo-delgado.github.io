    <h3>Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs Table</h3>
       <p> 18th August 2016 <p>

    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>

         <p>So far I am enjoying my experience at EDA. I like how we have a chanel so we can discuss and help each
           other out and I am pleased that we each get a one-to-one with a tutor every week.</p>

    <h3>Impressions of EDA</h3>

         <p> EDA is a original coding bootcamp it has grown a
            lot since it’s first days as an experiment. This gives me the impression that they are a successful
            and reliable company to study with. <p>

    <h3>  How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>

         <p> I will be engaging with this culture by learning new technology and surrounding myself with people
           in the industry.  </p>

    <h3>Expectations of EDA </h3>

        <p>My expectations of EDA haven’t changed.  From the begining I have always expected to be ready to start my career
        in web development by the time I graduate. </p>


    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
       Does it make you nervous?</h3>

        <p>I'm really excited to be involved in this kind of learning environment and I look forward to
          meeting everyone on the cohort. Yes I am a bit nervous as it is a big change in career for me so I expect
          it to be very challenging. disabled=""</p>
