         <p class="p-reflections">So far I am enjoying my experience at EDA. I like how we have a chanel so we can discuss and help each
           other out and I am pleased that we each get a one-to-one with our tutor every week.
           EDA is a original coding bootcamp it has grown a lot since it’s first days as an experiment. This gives me the impression that they are a successful
            and reliable company to study with.
          I will be engaging with this culture by learning new technology and surrounding myself with people
           in the industry.
          My expectations of EDA haven’t changed.  From the begining I have always expected to be ready to start my career
         in web development by the time I graduate.
         I'm really excited to be involved in this kind of learning environment and I look forward to
          meeting everyone on the cohort. Yes I am a bit nervous as it is a big change in career for me so I expect
          it to be very challenging.</p>
